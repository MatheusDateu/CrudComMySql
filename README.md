# 📁 Simple Database Connection Project - CRUD With MySQL

Welcome to my simple database connection project repository! In this repository, you'll find a compact yet powerful example of how to connect to a database without using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like Entity Framework. I've employed MySQL as the database engine for this project, as it perfectly suits the needs of this small-scale application.
